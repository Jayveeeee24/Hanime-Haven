                    <li>This is only made as a university project, not as an actual video streaming website.</li>
                    <li>This project was made back in 2019 by a group of try-hard weeb students who have a bad taste in anime. Check the About Us page for more info ;)</li>
                    <li>Some types of media within the project are replaced with placeholder content to save storage space.</li>
                    <li>All video content is replaced with everyone's favourite Chika Dance! An amount still insufficient for an average person's daily required consumption of Chika Dances.</li>
                    <li>All audio content is replaced with DAOKO and Kenshi Yonezu's Fireworks, an official soundtrack for the movie "Fireworks".</li>
